SUMMARY:The stunning Beijing National Stadium, commonly known as the
  Birds Nest became the centrepiece for one of the most spectacular
  Olympic Games of all time in 2008
DESCRIPTION:Twickenham Stadium, in a leafy London suburb with
  riverside pathways and cosy pubs, is arguably the most famous rugby
  venue on the planet. Twickers has recently been redeveloped and now
  has a capacity of 82,000. The stadium tour and museum covers
  everything from the global game, including interactive exhibits and
  historic memorabilia. Keep an eyeout for tickets to upcoming
  internationals, while the club game often uses the venue for crunch
  matches.
